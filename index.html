            I Like Tiger's Appearance & its Physical power.

            The Tiger / Tigress is a Majestic Wild Animal and it is also One among The Apex Predators since it is a Large Carnivorous Animal - Tigers are still found in The Natural Wild Forests of India, Nepal, Bangladesh, China, Siberia, Russia, Indonesia, Thailand and Bhutan etc.

        <p>
            If you take India & Bangladesh - Our Respective Nations have The Tigers as Our National Animal Symbols, since they are Powerful Beasts of Prey and can take down Large Game animals if required.
        </p>

            Why Tigers are liked is because of their Agility, Stripes, Colouration, Body Size, Strength & Ability to Camouflage in Tall grasses without being noticed.
